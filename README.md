# Book-Recommendation-System
This project creates a Machine Learning-based Collaborative Filtering Book Recommendation System using the K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN) algorithm. The model analyzes user ratings to identify similarities between books and recommend ones that are most like those the user has interacted with. The trained model is integrated into a Streamlit app, allowing users to input a book title and receive personalized book suggestions along with their posters. This system leverages machine learning to provide accurate, data-driven book recommendations, demonstrating the effectiveness of collaborative filtering in creating personalized user experiences.
