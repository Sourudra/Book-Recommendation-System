# Book-Recommendation-System
This project creates a Machine Learning-based Collaborative Filtering Book Recommendation System using the K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN) algorithm, which is an unsupervised learning technique. The model analyzes user ratings to find similarities between books by calculating distances between their features. It then recommends books that are closest to those the user has interacted with, based on these similarities. The trained model is integrated into a Streamlit app, allowing users to input a book title and receive personalized book suggestions along with their posters. By leveraging K-NN's ability to group similar items, this system provides accurate, data-driven recommendations and demonstrates the effectiveness of collaborative filtering in creating personalized user experiences.
